## Description

**MetaUI** is set of APIs and components that dynamically generates User Interface based on your object model (JSON object + its type).
It does so without developers having to layout components in template files. MetaUI uses rules (Meta Rules) to generate the UI.

This project is based on our original work on `@aribaui`and `aribaweb`. The MetaUI portion have been extracted and ported to Javascript. 
Our goal is make it lightweight, framework and component library agnostic. It transforms the typical UI development model from one where
a developer layouts out all UI components in multiple template files to one where a developer defines rules and leverages MetaUI engine to
create UI. MetaUI rules can be applied universally or to a specific object.

You can also read more in the [High Level Architecture][1].


Sections below focus on the _MetaUI_ therefore it is recommended that you watch our online presentations that give
you some ideas about Rule driven User Interface.

### Why MetaUI

```
MetaUI is new, innovative way that allows you to build highly customizable front-end applications without 
writing HTML markup.

Not only can MetaUI make your applications more consistent, but additionally it can reduce amount of 
overall code you need to write. This reduction in code reduces overall development cost.
